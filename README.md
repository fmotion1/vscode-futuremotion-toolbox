## Introduction

VS-Toolbox is planned to be a general utility extension that implements a broad range of workflow enhancements. The extension is currently a work in process and only implements a few commands right now. More additional functionality is planned for the near future.


## Implemented Commands (Release v1.0.0)

**All of these commands can be invoked by the context menu or command palette.**

* Remove line breaks from the selection.
* Compact selected CSS definitions to a single line.
* Expand selected CSS definitions back to multiple lines.
* Rename CSS variables in a single CSS file.
* Rename Powershell variables.

## Additional Planned Features

* Renaming CSS variables across multiple files in the repository.
* Showing inline decorations that display a reference count for any specific CSS variable. This will allow you to isolate and remove unused variables quickly.
